The skeletons only contain stripped down boilerplate code that is easier to create using the command-line tool rather than by hand.\n\nTo create a skeleton for a Mojito application:\n\n    mojito create app [<archetype-name>] <app-name>\n\nThis will create an empty application (i.e., one with no mojits) with the name provided. The application is created in a directory named `<app-name>` within the current directory. If no archetype name is provided, the default archetype is used.\n\nFrom the application directory, use the following command to create a skeleton for a mojit:\n\n    mojito create mojit [<archetype-name>] <mojit-name>\n\nThis will create an empty mojit with the name provided. The command assumes it is being executed within an application directory. Thus, the mojit is created in a directory named `<mojit-name>` within the `mojits` subdirectory of the application directory. For example, the mojit `MyMojit` would be created in `mojits/MyMojit`.\n\nAs with application creation, if no archetype name is provided, the default archetype is used. Depending upon the archetype, the skeleton may include any or all of the following: controller, model, view, and binder\n\nMojito Archetypes\n-----------------\n\nMojito offers the following three archetypes for applications and mojits.\n\n* `simple` - The minimal configuration and code needed to run an application.\n* `default` - This archetype is run if no command-line archetype option is specified. It is a happy medium between simple and full.\n* `full` - Provides the most comprehensive configuration and code for applications.\n\nMojito Demo Apps\n----------------\n\nMojito also offers the demo app `quickstartguide` that is an example app displaying documentation.\nTo `quickstartguide` app, run the following:\n\n    mojito create demo quickstartguide <name>\n\nYou can also create your own demo apps by placing them under the `archetypes/demo` directory and\nthen running the following command:\n\n    mojito create demo <your_demo_app> <name>\n\nCustom Archetypes\n-----------------\n\nYou can copy the [built-in](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito-cli-create/tree/master/archetypes) archetypes and modify them to suit your work-flow, or create your own. Then you can specify the path to specific archetype, like so:\n\n    mojito create custom <path/to/archtype> <path/to/name>\n\nIf a file in the archetype source ends with `.hb` then the contents of the file will have key/value replacement done for the following:\n\n* `{{name}}` -> the name passed as the last command line argument that is not a flag or option. The\n  name is lowercased and used for the module name of mojit code.\n* `{{class}}` -> is the sname as `{{name}}` except the value is not lowercased. The value is used for the class name\n  of mojit code.\n\nYou can also specify the option `--keyval` or `-k` to replace  key/value pairs in a string.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the archetype directory `../menus` that has the one file `today.html.hb` containing the Handlebars expressions `{{dish}}` and `{{side}}`. Running the command `mojito create custom ../menus TodaysMenu -k dish:tilapia,side:macaroni` would create the new directory `TodaysMenu` containing the file `today.html` (notice that the \".hb\" extension is removed). In `today.html`, all occurrences of the strings `{{dish}}` and `{{side}}` would be replaced with `tilapia` and `macaroni`.\n\nDiscussion/Forums\n-----------------\n\nhttp://developer.yahoo.com/forum/Yahoo-Mojito\n\nLicensing and Contributions\n---------------------------\n\nBSD, see LICENSE.txt.
