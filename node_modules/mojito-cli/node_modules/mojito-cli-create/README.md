mojito-cli-create  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yahoo/mojito-cli-create.png)](https://travis-ci.org/yahoo/mojito-cli-create)
=================

This package provides the `create` command for the [`mojito-cli`](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito-cli) tool, that you can install with: `npm install -g mojito-cli`

Creating Code from Archetypes
-----------------------------

Archetypes are used to create skeletons for the different types of artifacts in a Mojito application. The skeletons only contain stripped down boilerplate code that is easier to create using the command-line tool rather than by hand.

To create a skeleton for a Mojito application:

    mojito create app [<archetype-name>] <app-name>

This will create an empty application (i.e., one with no mojits) with the name provided. The application is created in a directory named `<app-name>` within the current directory. If no archetype name is provided, the default archetype is used.

From the application directory, use the following command to create a skeleton for a mojit:

    mojito create mojit [<archetype-name>] <mojit-name>

This will create an empty mojit with the name provided. The command assumes it is being executed within an application directory. Thus, the mojit is created in a directory named `<mojit-name>` within the `mojits` subdirectory of the application directory. For example, the mojit `MyMojit` would be created in `mojits/MyMojit`.

As with application creation, if no archetype name is provided, the default archetype is used. Depending upon the archetype, the skeleton may include any or all of the following: controller, model, view, and binder

Mojito Archetypes
-----------------

Mojito offers the following three archetypes for applications and mojits.

* `simple` - The minimal configuration and code needed to run an application.
* `default` - This archetype is run if no command-line archetype option is specified. It is a happy medium between simple and full.
* `full` - Provides the most comprehensive configuration and code for applications.

Mojito Demo Apps
----------------

Mojito also offers the demo app `quickstartguide` that is an example app displaying documentation.
To `quickstartguide` app, run the following:

    mojito create demo quickstartguide <name>

You can also create your own demo apps by placing them under the `archetypes/demo` directory and
then running the following command:

    mojito create demo <your_demo_app> <name>

Custom Archetypes
-----------------

You can copy the [built-in](https://github.com/yahoo/mojito-cli-create/tree/master/archetypes) archetypes and modify them to suit your work-flow, or create your own. Then you can specify the path to specific archetype, like so:

    mojito create custom <path/to/archtype> <path/to/name>

If a file in the archetype source ends with `.hb` then the contents of the file will have key/value replacement done for the following:

* `{{name}}` -> the name passed as the last command line argument that is not a flag or option. The
  name is lowercased and used for the module name of mojit code.
* `{{class}}` -> is the sname as `{{name}}` except the value is not lowercased. The value is used for the class name
  of mojit code.

You can also specify the option `--keyval` or `-k` to replace  key/value pairs in a string.

For example, suppose you have the archetype directory `../menus` that has the one file `today.html.hb` containing the Handlebars expressions `{{dish}}` and `{{side}}`. Running the command `mojito create custom ../menus TodaysMenu -k dish:tilapia,side:macaroni` would create the new directory `TodaysMenu` containing the file `today.html` (notice that the ".hb" extension is removed). In `today.html`, all occurrences of the strings `{{dish}}` and `{{side}}` would be replaced with `tilapia` and `macaroni`.
